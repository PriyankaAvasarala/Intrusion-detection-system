While IoT has opened up many possibilities and applications in areas such as home automation, robots, alarm systems, and healthcare, it has also led to an increase in security vulnerabilities. The potential consequences of these vulnerabilities are significant, as they could allow criminals to gain control over these systems and cause devastating consequences. To establish a safe IT environment, it is important to take proactive steps to combat cyber risks associated with IoT devices. One such step is to have a thorough understanding of network behavior. Network behavior anomaly detection is a process that involves identifying anomalous network behavior, such as high traffic volume during typically quiet times. This solution is effective in addressing gaps left by conventional cybersecurity technologies, but it is most efficient when used in conjunction with other solutions.
The primary goal of this project is to target and eliminate vulnerabilities that could compromise network security. This includes abnormal network activity, such as unauthorized software or unusual port usage by a known program. It also includes data exfiltration, such as unusually high data transmission rates, monitoring outbound data transmissions, and notifying security personnel in real-time if hidden dangers like sophisticated spyware are detected. To ensure effective security countermeasures, it is essential to combine network behavior anomaly detection with other security technologies. This approach can alert concerned parties to the possibility of an attack evading perimeter defenses. The deployment of such countermeasures can go a long way in protecting IoT systems from potential breaches and other security threats.
The use of IoT devices has grown exponentially in recent years, and this growth is expected to continue. As such, it is important to address the security vulnerabilities associated with these devices proactively. This project's primary aim is to address the security threats to IoT networks, including abnormal network behavior and data exfiltration, through the deployment of security countermeasures. Combining network behavior anomaly detection with other security technologies is key to effectively protecting IoT networks from potential breaches and other security threats.
